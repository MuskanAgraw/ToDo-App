Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine. 
### `git clone <repository-url>`

Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your current directory to the project directory.
### 'cd <project-directory>'

Install Dependencies: Install the necessary dependencies by running.
### 'npm install'

Start the Development Server: Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running.
### 'npm start'

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Interact with the Application: You can now interact with the Todo application. Add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, edit tasks, and set due dates for tasks.

Stop the Development Server: To stop the development server, press 'Ctrl + C' in the terminal where the server is running.

Testing: You can run tests using the following command:
   ### 'npm test'
   
Build for Production: To build the production application, run:
    See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
    ### 'npm run build'



Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
